 * A token-based paymaster that accepts token deposit
 * The deposit is only a safeguard: the user pays with his token balance.
 *  only if the user didn't approve() the paymaster, or if the token balance is not enough, the deposit will be used.
 *  thus the required deposit is to cover just one method call.
 * The deposit is locked for the current block: the user must issue unlockTokenDeposit() to be allowed to withdraw
 *  (but can't use the deposit for this or further operations)
 *
 * paymasterAndData holds the paymaster address followed by the token address to use.
 * @notice This paymaster will be rejected by the standard rules of EIP4337, as it uses an external oracle.
 * (the standard rules ban accessing data of an external contract)
 * It can only be used if it is "whitelisted" by the bundler.
 * (technically, it can be used by an "oracle" which returns a static value, without accessing any storage)
